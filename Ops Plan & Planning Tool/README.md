# Assignment Distribution Planning Project

This repository contains the core components of a project focused on daily assignment planning for medical abstractors across multiple healthcare facilities. The main goal was to create an efficient system for matching qualified abstractors with facility requests based on various factors such as skills, availability, and time constraints.

## Main Files

1. `assignment_distribution_planning_story.ipynb`
   - This Jupyter notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of the assignment planning process.
   - It includes explanations, code snippets, and examples of how the daily assignment planning was executed.
   - This notebook serves as both documentation and an operational guide for the assignment creation process.

2. `helper_fx.py`
   - This Python script contains utility functions used throughout the assignment planning process.
   - It provides helper functions for rounding hiring needs and other calculations required for the assignment logic.

3. `sf_queries_class.py`
   - This Python script defines a class (`SfQueries`) for interacting with Salesforce API.
   - It contains methods for querying and processing data from Salesforce, which were crucial for fetching and updating assignment-related information.

## Additional Context

While this repository includes the main components of the assignment distribution planning system, some business-sensitive files have been omitted due to confidentiality reasons. However, these three files should provide a comprehensive overview of how daily assignments were created and executed.

The `assignment_distribution_planning_story.ipynb` notebook offers the most detailed explanation of the process, including how the helper functions and Salesforce queries were utilized.

To gain a full understanding of the project, it's recommended to start with the Jupyter notebook, which will provide context for how the Python scripts (`helper_fx.py` and `sf_queries_class.py`) were integrated into the overall assignment planning process.
