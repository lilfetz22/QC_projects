# Report Automation

This folder houses the automation of several different tools that we use to understand our current demand and forecast our hiring needs. The following four key files are included:

1. Opportunity_binary_classification.ipynb
2. redundant_capacity.ipynb
3. staffing_model_creation.ipynb
4. supply_demand_summary.ipynb

## Opportunity_binary_classification.ipynb

This notebook implements a binary classification model for opportunities. It uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of winning or losing an opportunity based on various features. The model helps in prioritizing sales efforts and resource allocation.

## redundant_capacity.ipynb

The redundant_capacity notebook focuses on optimizing resource allocation across different projects. It identifies opportunities to redistribute experienced personnel to high-priority assignments while backfilling their previous positions with qualified trainees. This tool maximizes the efficiency of resource utilization while ensuring all projects maintain appropriate skill coverage.

## staffing_model_creation.ipynb

This notebook is responsible for creating staffing models. It analyzes current capacity, demand, and pipeline data to forecast hiring needs. The model takes into account factors such as attrition rates, project timelines, and skill requirements to provide accurate staffing projections.

## supply_demand_summary.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook implements an automated system for analyzing and reporting on workforce supply and demand across different business categories. The system helps management make informed decisions about resource allocation, hiring needs, and capacity planning by comparing available workforce capacity against current business demands.

Together, these tools form a comprehensive suite for demand analysis and workforce planning, enabling data-driven decision-making in resource management and hiring strategies.
